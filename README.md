## Libraries and Tools
- Flask
- Pandas
- Numpy

## Things Todo
- ✔️ Select any dataset in CSV or Excel format from the provided link, and update the file by
specifying the data you are working on along your group members with the names of
- ✔️ Clean and prepare this data using pandas. (Fill in missing values. Do not allow invalid values
in any column. Convert strings to numeric data etc. etc. If data is already cleaned then you may
introduce some missing values, invalid values yourself and then clean them)
- ✔️ Use statistics on different columns of datasets like mean, median, mode, std,variance,
correlation etc etc. Visualize these statistics and different features of this dataset through graphs
using MatplotLib and Seaborn library (we will study in next lab)
- ✔️ Apply any machine learning algorithm using sklearn library (we will study in next lab)
- [] Create UI either (Desktop App using Tkinter, or WebApp using Flask or Django)
